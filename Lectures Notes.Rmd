# Week 1
## Matrix Derivatives

If we want to explain a vector $y_{n \times 1}$ with $X_{n \times p}$, we need a vector $\beta_{p \times 1}$ that minimize $$\lVert y_{n \times 1} - X_{n \times p}\beta_{p \times 1} \rVert$$
And the minimum of this expression is $$ \hat{\beta} = (x^tx)^{-1}x^ty $$

### Example
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```
We define our y, x and $\beta$ variables

\%\*\% matrix multiplication

solve(a) calculates inverse of a

solve(a,b) solves equation a %*% x = b

```{r}
y = mtcars$mpg
x = cbind(1,mtcars$wt, mtcars$hp)
beta = solve(t(x) %*% x) %*% t(x) %*% y
beta
```
We can check that we obtain the same vector than if we use the function lm
```{r}
coef(lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, data = mtcars))
```
